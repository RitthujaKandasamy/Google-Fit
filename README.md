# Google-Fit

## Week Plan:    
*Monday*: Understanding the data, how it has been collected and preprocessed. Create Metadata about sensorsâ€™ outputs.  

*Tuesday*: EDA  and Preprocessing. Selection of final model.  

*Wednesday*:   
* Before noon: Tuning the model (hyperparamater tuning, data enhancement).  
* Afternoon: Design the App(what features to add, how it should look like) + first version of the App (we use streamlit)  

*Thursday*: Finish the App and prepare final presentation.  

*Friday*:  
Morning (Last fixes in case any)  
Afternoon (Last rehearsal for presentation)  



## Today's Plan (Tuesday)  
*EDA* (Ritthu)  
Using Graphext explore the followings:  

* Missing values (how many in each column in %)  
* Distribution of features (histogram + kde)   
* Is target balanced?  
* Correlations between features and relation between features and target  
* Prepare final plots for presentation  


*PREPROCESSING* (Theo)  
* Cleaning data (any column/row to drop)  
* Missing value imputation  
* Create functions and pipelines to easily run experimentations  
* Try out first chosen models
